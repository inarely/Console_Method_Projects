# Methods Exercises in C#

This project contains ten small C# exercises focused on understanding how methods work.  
Each task demonstrates a simple use case of defining, calling, and returning values from methods.  
The exercises are written in a single console program and executed one after another.

4. **PowNumberMethod** — returns the square of a number.  
5. **MaxNumber** — determines which of the two numbers is greater.  
6. **CharsInString** — counts how many characters are in a given string.  
7. **ToUpperCase** — converts the entered string into upper case.  
8. **IsNumberInRange** — checks if a number is within the range of 10 to 20.  
9. **FactorialMethod** — calculates the factorial of a number.  
10. **PalindromeMethod** — checks if a number is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
