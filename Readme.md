# Methods Exercises in C#

This project contains ten small C# exercises focused on understanding how methods work.  
Each task demonstrates a simple use case of defining, calling, and returning values from methods.  
The exercises are written in a single console program and executed one after another.

---

## Description of Exercises

1. **NameOfPerson** — asks the user for a name and displays a greeting message.  
2. **SumOfNumbers** — accepts two numbers and returns their sum.  
3. **IsEven** — checks whether a given number is even.  
4. **PowNumberMethod** — returns the square of a number.  
5. **MaxNumber** — determines which of the two numbers is greater.  
6. **CharsInString** — counts how many characters are in a given string.  
7. **ToUpperCase** — converts the entered string into upper case.  
8. **IsNumberInRange** — checks if a number is within the range of 10 to 20.  
9. **FactorialMethod** — calculates the factorial of a number.  
10. **PalindromeMethod** — checks if a number is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).

## Key Concepts

- Method declaration and naming conventions  
- Parameters and return values  
- Conditional logic and loops  
- String processing and numeric operations  
- Clear console interaction and user input handling

# Methods Out Exercises in C#

This project contains ten C# exercises focused on practicing the use of the `out` keyword in methods.  
Each task demonstrates how to return multiple values from a method, process user input, and perform basic calculations.  
All exercises are implemented within a single console program and executed one after another.

## Description of Exercises

1. **SumAndDifference** — takes two integers and returns both their sum and difference.  
2. **DivideNumbers** — divides two integers and returns the quotient and the remainder.  
3. **FindMinMax** — determines the minimum and maximum values among three numbers.  
4. **ParseInteger** — safely converts a string into an integer using `int.TryParse()`.  
5. **GetRectangleData** — calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle based on user input.  
6. **ArrayMinMaxAverage** — analyzes an array and returns its minimum, maximum, and average values.  
7. **SplitFullName** — splits a full name into first and last names.  
8. **CalculateRoots** — finds the roots of a quadratic equation based on coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.  
9. **GetDataParts** — splits a date string (e.g., "20-09-2025") into day, month, and year.  
10. **GetTextData** — analyzes a text to count the number of characters, words, and sentences.

## Key Concepts

- Returning multiple values from methods using the `out` keyword  
- String manipulation (`Split`, `Trim`, `TryParse`, etc.)  
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations  
- Array processing and iteration  
- User input and console interaction
